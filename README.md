## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

Solana developers face unpredictable transaction execution:
- ❌ Transactions may fail due to congestion
- ❌ MEV bots can front-run important transactions
- ❌ No guarantee of execution order or inclusion

**Raiku solves this** with deterministic slot reservations — but understanding *how* requires visualization.

## 💡 Project Overview

**Raiku Slot Visualizer** turns Raiku's deterministic execution model into an **intuitive, educational, and developer-friendly visualization**.

It helps developers and users understand how **Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** and **Just-in-Time (JIT)** slot reservations make transaction inclusion **predictable, reliable, and MEV-free**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎬 **1. Visual Timeline**
- Interactive Solana slot timeline showing reserved transaction order
- Color-coded slots (AOT = green, JIT = blue, empty = gray)
- Real-time animation of block progression

### ⚡ **2. Execution Guarantees Simulation**
- Toggle between AOT (pre-reserved slots) and JIT (just-in-time reservations)
- See how Raiku prevents transaction failures
- Compare guaranteed vs. non-guaranteed execution

### 📊 **3. Analytics Dashboard**
- **Congestion Monitor**: Network load visualization
- **Slot Utilization Metrics**: Reserved vs. available slots
- **Execution Certainty Score**: Reliability percentage
- **MEV Protection Indicator**: Shows front-running prevention

### 🎓 **4. Educational Mode**
Interactive explanations of Raiku primitives:
- **Ackermann Node**: Deterministic scheduling engine
- **AOT Reservations**: Pre-book slots for critical transactions
- **JIT Reservations**: Last-second guaranteed inclusion
- **Slot Ordering**: How Raiku maintains transaction sequence
